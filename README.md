# 3 Positions
Voltage Controlled 3 position switch 7HP Eurorack Module.

It has a control voltage input for the current position. This input is connected to another jack, so you can send this thru to another module.
The output is summed with an offset input and has another socket connected (a "multiple").

The 3 input voltage range is -5 to +5 volt. when higher, it can be attenuated to prevent clipping.

The position is selected with control voltages.
"+": above +1.7 volts.
"o": between -1.7 and + 1.7 volts.
"-": below -1.7 volts

The DXF frontpanel file can be used for lasercutting. It has 5mm holes for the LEDs. The holes for the jacks are for PJ-301m-12 (Thonkiconns). The holes are 7.7mm so that the panel leans on the flat surface of the jacks plastic, so you can also use 3mm thick material if you want.
